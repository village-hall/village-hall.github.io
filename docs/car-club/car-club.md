# Welcome to Tilton on the Hill Electric Club

Introducing Leicestershire's first all electric car club.

The car club is the first of its kind in Leicestershire and has been developed by local people. It’s a car club run by the village for the benefit of residents of the Tilton and Halstead Parish. 
It officially launches on Saturday the 16th September 2023 and it would be lovely to see you there.

## The Tilton Electric Car Club offers great opportunities to:

* Have the benefits of an electric car without the costs of ownership
* Reduce our impact on the planet 
* Improve local air quality - as there are no tailpipe emissions 
* Build community – through lift-sharing and helping residents in our community that are less mobile

## Membership

There are 3 types of Membership:

* Driver Member to simply drive the cars
* Need a Lift Member for less mobile residents who need lifts
* Volunteer Driver Member to drive less mobile people in the community who need lifts **(Membership is FREE OF CHARGE when driving as a volunteer)** 

### Membership and Hire charges

To book a car on an **occasional** basis the club charges £10 per month for membership and a hire charge of £10 per hour or £70 per day. 
If you book a car on a **frequent** basis, the fee is £30 per month and a hire charge of £5 per hour or £45 per day. 
In both cases membership applies to either an individual or two adults at the same address.

### No hidden costs

There are no hidden costs as Green Fox (a not-for-profit Leicestershire co-operative) pays for the electricity to fuel the car (when charged at the Village Hall), insurance, the booking system, breakdown cover, MOT, servicing, and maintenance. 
There is no mileage charge.

## Electric cars are:

* Nearly 4 times more efficient per mile compared to petrol or diesel
* Comfortable for passengers and more responsive for drivers
* Considerably quieter so there’s less noise pollution 
* Automatic so easy to drive with induction training provided
