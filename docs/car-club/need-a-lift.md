# Need a Lift Scheme Guidelines

When thinking about your lift request, if you are able to share your journey with others, this would be helpful for volunteers, cheaper and more sociable. 
Regular journeys at times when volunteers and cars are available should be easier to diarise. 

## The Practicalities      

* To provide enough notice for a volunteer to consider your request please allow a minimum of 1 week notice. 
If you haven’t had your requests confirmed 48 hours before your journey, please assume that a volunteer is not available. 
Until a booking is confirmed you won’t be charged.
* To calculate the journey time, use the [AA route planner](https://www.theaa.com/route-planner/route) to provide the approximate timing of your requested journey. 
When booking add an additional time to allow the driver to check, collect and return the cars and for traffic delays to ensure the car is returned for the next user.
* If your journey can be flexible in terms of time of day or date, please add this to the Notes when you make a booking request.
* Think of the volunteers and try to keep journeys within sociable hours from 8.30am to 10pm
* All our volunteer drivers give their time freely, are DBS checked and receive training.
* Children and young people under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian if they are traveling in a car as part of the Need A Lift Scheme.

## Distances

It is easier for volunteers to accommodate shorter, local trips (to local towns, villages or Leicester). 
If you need occasional trips that are further afield you can ask to see if this will be possible. 

Please remember that lifts can only be provided when a volunteer and car are available, so when possible, please avoid busy times of day. 
As the scheme develops, we aim to recruit more volunteer drivers. 

Hopefully you will find the scheme easy to use and helpful.
