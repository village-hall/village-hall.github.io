title: Pet Policy
---

The club recognises that some members may have a need to take pets with them on journeys, whilst others, either through personal preference or pet allergies, prefer to avoid cars where pets have been.

Therefore, in the interests of maximising the use of cars for the village, this policy has been designed so as not to exclude pet owners, nor inconvenience other users. 

In terms of our insurance, we are required to comply with Rule 57 of the Highway code which states:

:::caution
“When in a vehicle make sure dogs or other animals are suitable retrained so they cannot distract you while you are driving or injure you, or themselves, if you stop quickly. A seat belt harness, pet carrier, dog cage or dog guard are ways of retraining animals in cars”
:::

In addition, it is an insurance stipulation that at no time can pets be left on their own within the car. This is for the pet’s health and safety and mitigates any damage to the car such as chewing and scratching.

Specific arrangements by the club:
1.	Only one car (registration VN70YHR) is designated to carry pets. Please only book this car if you intend to carry a pet & book the other one if you need to avoid being where the pets have been.
2.	To minimise contamination from pet hairs, mud etc. we have decided that the only place a pet can travel is in the boot. 
Guidance when carrying a pet
1.	If carrying a small pet, please use a cage/carrier.
2.	If a cage is not practical or won’t fit in the boot (e.g. for a larger dog) please use a dog bed or similar to minimise hairs etc being left in the boot.
3.	If pets such as dogs need to jump into the boot & cannot be lifted, please minimise scratches to the bumper from their paws by using a cloth or towel, noting this may make it slippery when they jump in. 
4.	When returning the car, after removing the cage / bed, please check & remove any excessive hairs or mess before leaving the car for the next user.

We will continue to seek feedback from drivers / passengers regarding the effectiveness of the above arrangements and may amend this policy if required.
