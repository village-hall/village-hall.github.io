Membership of the club is open to all residents who live in or near the village. 
We currently have about 30 families who are members and are keen to increase the number. 
The court is situated behind the village hall and supports tennis, five-a-side football and basketball. 
It has floodlights for evening use.

The annual membership fees are currently £40 for a family, £20 for an individual and £10 for a junior (under 18).
